Given a set of n nuts of different sizes and n bolts of different sizes. There is a one-one mapping between nuts and bolts. Match nuts and bolts efficiently. <br /><br />
**Constraint:** Comparison of a nut to another nut or a bolt to another bolt is not allowed. It means nut can only be compared with bolt and bolt can only be compared with nut to see which one is bigger/smaller.

Other way of asking this problem is, given a box with locks and keys where one lock can be opened by one key in the box. We need to match the pair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design an algorithm for the problem that uses nlogn compares (probabilistically).
